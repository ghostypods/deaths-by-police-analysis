<h1>Fatal Force: Deaths by police in the United States of America Data Analysis</h1>

<p>This is an anlaysis of fatal police shootings recorded by The Washington Post since January 1, 2015. By utilizing Python, Pandas, Plotly, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this data can be analyzed to find patterns hidden within these fatalities. Are there correlations between the victims and thier race, gender, income, and other factors? This project aims to find those patters and answer these quesitons.</p>

<h3>How to use</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Download the '.ipynb' file and open it in <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Google Colab</a></li>
  <li>Download the '.csv' files and drop them in the files section in Google Colab (the icon for the files section looks like a folder)</li>
  <li>Click the keyboar combo Ctrl+F9 (on windows) to run the whole file. You can also run the file by clicking Runtime >> Run all</li>
</ol>

These findings offer valuable insights into the multifaceted issue of police shootings in the U.S., suggesting areas for deeper examination and conversation.
<h3>Data Visuals</h3>
<p>The analysis utilizes a variety of graphs to provide insights into the dataset:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Plotly Bar Graph</li>
  <li>Plotly Bar Chart</li>
  <li>Plotly Pie Chart</li>
  <li>Plotly Choropleth Map</li>

</ul>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>The data analysis revealed several key findings</p>
<ul>
  <li>Police shooting incidents have fluctuated over the years.</li>
  <li>Racial groups are not equally represented in police shooting incidents, with some experiencing a disproportionate impact.</li>
  <li>The data shows a specific gender breakdown among individuals involved in police shootings.</li>
  <li>A number of individuals fatally shot by police were reported to be in a mental health crisis.</li>
  <li>Some cities and states recorded a higher frequency of police shooting incidents than others.</li>
  <li>The analysis details the prevalence of victims being armed and its connection to the outcomes.</li>
  <li>The ages of individuals involved in police shootings are distributed unevenly, with certain age groups more represented.</li>
  <li>A potential link exists between the poverty rate in an area and the incidence of police shootings.</li>
</ul>
<p>These findings offer valuable insights into the multifaceted issue of police shootings in the U.S., suggesting areas for deeper examination and conversation.</p>
